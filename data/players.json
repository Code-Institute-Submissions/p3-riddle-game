While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior.This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East - gate of Moria.At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet \"Oakenshield,\" which would remain with him even in death.",
